Please note file assignment 3 completle level shows an Idea of what game is supposed to look like. 
(sorry its choppy I recorded it using stream labs on my laptop)
Anyways the video shows the functionality of the restart collision with the goal cube
As mentioned in readme missing being able to kill enemies and dying from bullets
But videos show colliding with the enemy that chases or the goal cube ends the game
